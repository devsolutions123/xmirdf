    BTM as a “profession” must be viewed beyond its existing job roles loosely based on undergraduate educational&#xD;
    credentials. It must be defined by people committed to meeting standards, setting personal goals to learn and master&#xD;
    their tradecraft, and passing on this commitment to later generations.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>&#xD;
    BTM BOK as a “knowledge initiative” seeks to harmonize all facets of how professionals lead their community learning&#xD;
    dynamics (Figure 3). It integrates academic research communities with professional practice specializations. It helps&#xD;
    transforming IS-IT into an Evidence-Based Profession (EBP), with seamless integration of knowledge development,&#xD;
    testing, validation, learning, practice, and feedback.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;

&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>&#xD;
    BTM needs a critical mass of people who rank as valuable experts, mastering a broad skillset honed with minimum&#xD;
    experience requirements, and recognized by promotion through ranks as these skills become in high demand. They can best&#xD;
    identify with the profession if it develops a vibrant and future-minded spirit, with promising and well-paid positions.&#xD;
    Reputation is also key, as candidates must first know the profession for its well-defined value-adding services to&#xD;
    organizations and society. They are motivated to join when job roles are clear, with realistic and progressive&#xD;
    competency requirements, and easy access to a self-sustaining and self-regulating (even if not legally-binding)&#xD;
    professional board and job market.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;span lang=&quot;EN-CA&quot;>BTM is therefore an “emerging profession”, one that is rapidly meeting these conditions for critical&#xD;
    mass, as job roles are undergoing radical shifts, with new requirements for position descriptions, organizational&#xD;
    structures, and professional certifications and standards.&lt;/span>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;span lang=&quot;EN-CA&quot;>BTM practitioners are also changing the way they used to enter the profession. Typically, graduates&#xD;
    earned a BBA in IS and/or an MBA, especially following an IT undergraduate degree. They then pursued relatively&#xD;
    predictable career paths, often combining several certifications. For example, a frequent profile of IS grads included&#xD;
    roles in Business Analysis, Project Management, and IT Services Management as they were promoted through the ranks&#xD;
    within a typical corporate IT division.&lt;/span>&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>&#xD;
    &lt;span lang=&quot;EN-CA&quot;>Major shifts in BTM careers are challenging both employees and employers in developing a more&#xD;
    integrated vision of the profession. BTM experts are increasingly from diverse educational credentials, often combining&#xD;
    IT expertise gained during work experience within a non-technical profession. BTM profiles also combine a wider mix of&#xD;
    positions in corporate, consulting, and start-up environments. They often get broader responsibilities throughout the&#xD;
    Digital Adoption lifecycle, leading digital innovation, transformation, or optimization projects. BTM BOK aims to&#xD;
    reflect these changes and help professionals gain better positions in leading digital transformation initiatives in all&#xD;
    sectors.&lt;/span>&#xD;
