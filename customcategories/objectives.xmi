    BTM BOK as a “knowledge tool” aims to support IS-IT professionals to develop a unified BTM expertise, and help all&#xD;
    stakeholders at all levels to work together more seamlessly within a coherent profession (Figure 2). It is primarily&#xD;
    used to help coach the next generation of Leaders of the Digital Transformation, slogan describing its founding&#xD;
    organization, BTM Forum. It also serves to define the distinctive approaches to help strengthen the hybrid&#xD;
    business-technology-management acumen, which builds upon existing practices, and provide guidance on their common core&#xD;
    knowledge base. It also serves to broaden the vision of digital transformation from an information to a business focus.&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>&#xD;

    &lt;img alt=&quot;BTM objectives&quot; src=&quot;./resources/fig-02.png&quot; width=&quot;450&quot; height=&quot;200&quot; />&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>&#xD;
    The BTM vision is fueled by an emerging consensus within the profession on converging observations:&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;ol>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;>&#xD;
            BTM specializations, such as business analysis, project management, enterprise architecture, data analytics,&#xD;
            etc., share the same hybrid acumen in business and technology.&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;>&#xD;
            BTM specializations are essential to lead the digital transformation, with more diverse (still undefined)&#xD;
            career paths crossing beyond traditional roles, reaching increasingly at management, entrepreneurial, and&#xD;
            executive levels.&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
    &lt;li>&#xD;
        &lt;div align=&quot;justify&quot;>&#xD;
            BTM is still concerned with supporting operations but is more than ever the centerpiece of digital business&#xD;
            strategies in all sectors, with renewed focus on innovation and value creation.&#xD;
        &lt;/div>&#xD;
    &lt;/li>&#xD;
&lt;/ol>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>&#xD;
    BTM BOK as a “professional guide” aims at addressing these trends, creating seamless bridges between key&#xD;
    specializations, identifying expected competencies, and offering learning guidelines to develop new BTM expertise. It&#xD;
    can be used as a guide for individual and team-based professional development and learning. It describes the key roles,&#xD;
    core competencies, best practices, and supporting references of this emerging profession. It references and builds upon&#xD;
    several existing open BOKs and complements them by offering integration pathways between specializations. It seeks to&#xD;
    provide a simple logic to integrate complex practices around the core mission of digital transformation.&#xD;
