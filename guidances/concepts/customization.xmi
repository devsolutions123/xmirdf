    BTM BOK customization is essentially an “exploratory/experimental” process like R&amp;amp;D. It is encouraged through the&#xD;
    open availability of its contents in various editable and reusable formats. These open assets can have compounded value&#xD;
    as they get reused throughout several customization opportunities, leading to a “specification-driven” approach where&#xD;
    changes in assets get recovered throughout their continuously updated reuse endpoints (Figure 5).&#xD;
&lt;/p>&#xD;
&lt;p align=&quot;justify&quot;>&#xD;
    It can be leveraged among professionals for career development and certification, within organizations of all sectors&#xD;
    for HRM and best practice benchmarking, by higher education institutions for program accreditation, and by knowledge&#xD;
    base authors who can import and reuse as long as they share-alike their own derivatives. Reintegration of derivatives&#xD;
    within BTM BOK is dependent on active participation in community discussions, and exploratory efforts of like-minded&#xD;
    professionals.&#xD;
